## Intro
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that would allow the user to filter through a database of recorded UFO sightings. The webpage features the data recorded and is filterable by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the sighting. When the user is ready to perform the search, they would simply enter the keywords into the appropriate fields in the format of the placeholder text.

## Drawbacks and Recommendations
The main drawback of this webpage is that the filters cannot be used individually but rather all the fields need to be filled so that the search can be completed. In the future, I would include the countries and states that the data feature in the introduction so that the user has an idea of what type of data is available. I would also provide an infographic highlighting the areas that feature the most sightings.
